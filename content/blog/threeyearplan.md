Progress ==>>
 It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, but the problem was making out the time to actually do it.
 I was working two jobs, one at a Greek restaurant and the other at Farmboy; both very labour intensive, cooking cleaning , cooking, cleaning, and cleaning. I would have to decide at the end of the day wether I wanted to rest , or get back to my projects. Ususlay I would get back to work, but sometimes I would just want to rest.
 I also started getting into meetups, And would often call in sick to attend them, at the detriment to my own finances. After all, there was a reason I was working two jobs, it was so i could pay for school, and rent and food. I ended up sleeping on a friends couch for a while, who I technically still owe , and appreciate the support. I was also able to get a job at a company that I'm interested in, which I'm glad I did.
