# I'm grateful these are the problems I have now.

I'm grateful for the opportunities I have had, and the people I've met. I'm grateful for the experiences I've had, and the people I've met. I'm grateful for the friends I've made, and the people I've met.

I'm grateful for the time I've spent learning, and time I've spent building.
