# It's Not Your Fault You Don't Know React

<!-- Image: "Confused programmer" GIF - Someone looking overwhelmed at multiple monitors 
Suggested: The classic "Math lady" meme with equations floating around -->

Modern web development can feel like trying to build a house while everyone insists you use their favorite brand of power tools - without first teaching you about foundations, walls, or basic architecture. The React ecosystem, in particular, has become a maze of abstractions that often obscure what's really happening on your computer.

## The Abstraction Problem

React's abstractions aren't inherently bad - they're designed to make our lives easier. But when we learn React without understanding what it's abstracting away, we end up with knowledge gaps that haunt us later.

Take hooks for example. Things like `useState` and `useEffect` are just closures - something you've probably been working with since your first programming course. When you write:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## Server Components Are Just Encapsulation

All this clamoring about Next.js and server components "hiding state from the client" isn't revolutionary...

## The Build Tool Circus

The endless configuration of package managers and runtimes isn't about revolutionary technology...

## Core Programming Concepts You Already Know

If you understand these fundamentals, you already understand React:

### 1. Functions and Scope

### 2. Caching and Memoization

### 3. Event-Driven Programming

<!-- Image: Dominoes falling GIF representing event propagation
Alternatively: "This is where the fun begins" Star Wars meme about event bubbling -->

### 4. State Machines

<!-- Image: Complex Rube Goldberg machine GIF
Alternatively: "But it's honest work" farmer meme about managing state -->

## Moving Forward

<!-- Image: "Here we go again" GIF but with positive connotation
Alternatively: Success Kid meme "Learned React / Just applied what I already knew" -->

Instead of getting caught up in framework wars and tool debates...

[Conclusion content...]

<!-- Image: "You've had the power all along" Wizard of Oz GIF
Alternatively: Galaxy brain meme progression from "Learning React" to "Realizing it's just programming" -->

Remember: React is just a tool for building user interfaces. The fundamentals of programming haven't changed - they're just wearing new clothes.

<!-- Final Image: "Thank you for coming to my TED talk" meme
Alternatively: "And that's a fact" PewDiePie meme about React just being JavaScript -->
