# Breaking Rails: Adventures in Route Handling

When I set out to replace Rails' view layer with Astro, I didn't expect to end up rewriting the entire routing system. But that's exactly what happened. Here's the story of how a simple view layer replacement turned into an adventure in request routing and middleware manipulation.

## The Initial Break: The Astro Concern

It started innocently enough. I created an Astro concern to handle the transformation of Rails' view handling:

```ruby
module Astro
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    around_action :handle_astro_response

    rescue_from(ActionController::MissingExactTemplate) do |_exception|
      action = params[:action]
      controller = controller_name
      
      props = instance_variables.select { |v| 
        !v.to_s.start_with?('@_') && 
        v.to_s != '@rendered_format' && 
        v.to_s != '@marked_for_same_origin_verification' 
      }
      
      props_hash = props.map { |v| [v.to_s[1..-1], instance_variable_get(v)] }.to_h
      
      response.headers['X-Astro-View'] = "#{controller}/#{action}"
      
      render json: props_hash, content_type: 'application/json'
    end

    before_action do
      request.format = :json if request.xhr?
    end
  end

  private

  def handle_astro_response
    request.format = :json if request.headers['X-Requested-With'] == 'XMLHttpRequest'
    yield

    if response.body.blank? && request.format.json?
      props = instance_variables.select { |v| 
        !v.to_s.start_with?('@_') && 
        v.to_s != '@rendered_format' && 
        v.to_s != '@marked_for_same_origin_verification' 
      }
      
      props_hash = props.map { |v| [v.to_s[1..-1], instance_variable_get(v)] }.to_h
      response.headers['X-Astro-View'] = "#{controller_name}/#{action_name}"
      render json: props_hash
    end
  end
end
```

This concern did something interesting: it intercepted Rails' normal view rendering and instead returned JSON with a special header indicating which Astro view should render the response. But this was just the beginning of our routing adventure.

## The Routing Challenge

The real complexity emerged when we needed to handle routing between Rails and Astro. We couldn't just use Rails' routing system anymore - we needed something that could coordinate between two different servers. Enter the custom Astro adapter:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import adapter from "./adapter/index.mjs";
import { experimental_AstroContainer } from "astro/container";

export default defineConfig({
  output: "server",
  adapter: adapter(),
  srcDir: "./app/views",
  integrations: [
    {
      name: "aor:dev",
      hooks: {
        async "astro:server:setup"({ server }) {
          const container = await experimental_AstroContainer.create();

          server.middlewares.use(async function middleware(
            incomingMessage,
            res,
            next
          ) {
            const request = toRequest(incomingMessage);
            if (!request.url) return next();

            const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
            const stringifiedProps = searchParams.get("props");
            const view = searchParams.get("view");
            
            if (!view) {
              return writeResponse(new Response(null, { status: 400 }), res);
            }

            let props = { message: "Placeholder" };
            if (stringifiedProps) {
              props = JSON.parse(stringifiedProps);
            }

            try {
              const page = await server.ssrLoadModule(
                `./app/views/${view}.astro`
              );
              const response = await container.renderToResponse(page.default, {
                request,
                props,
              });
              writeResponse(response, res);
            } catch (e) {
              const message = e instanceof Error ? e.message : `${e}`;
              writeResponse(new Response(message, { status: 400 }), res);
            }
          });
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## The Plot Thickens: Request Transformation

One of the trickiest parts was handling the transformation of requests between Node.js and Rails formats. We needed to carefully preserve headers, handle body content, and manage different types of requests:

```typescript
function toRequest(req: NodeRequest) {
  const protocol = req.headers["x-forwarded-proto"] ?? 
    ("encrypted" in req.socket && req.socket.encrypted ? "https" : "http");
  const hostname = req.headers["x-forwarded-host"] ?? 
    req.headers.host ?? 
    req.headers[":authority"];
  const port = req.headers["x-forwarded-port"];

  const portInHostname = typeof hostname === "string" && 
    typeof port === "string" && 
    hostname.endsWith(port);
  const hostnamePort = portInHostname ? 
    hostname : 
    hostname + (port ? `:${port}` : "");

  const url = `${protocol}://${hostnamePort}${req.url}`;
  const options: RequestInit = {
    method: req.method || "GET",
    headers: makeRequestHeaders(req),
  };

  if (options.method !== "HEAD" && options.method !== "GET") {
    Object.assign(options, makeRequestBody(req));
  }

  const request = new Request(url, options);
  
  // Handle client IP address
  const clientIp = req.headers["x-forwarded-for"];
  if (clientIp) {
    Reflect.set(request, clientAddressSymbol, clientIp);
  } else if (req.socket?.remoteAddress) {
    Reflect.set(request, clientAddressSymbol, req.socket.remoteAddress);
  }
  
  return request;
}
```

## Lessons Learned

This adventure in breaking Rails taught me several important lessons:

1. **Everything is Connected**: In Rails, the routing system is intimately connected to the view layer. You can't just replace one without affecting the other.

2. **Middleware Matters**: Much of the complexity in our solution came from properly handling middleware and request transformation. The devil is in the details of headers, body content, and request formats.

3. **Error Handling is Critical**: When you're dealing with two different servers, error handling becomes twice as important. You need to catch and properly handle errors at multiple levels.

4. **Performance Considerations**: While our solution worked, it introduced additional network hops between Astro and Rails. This meant we needed to be extra careful about performance optimization.

## The Unexpected Benefits

Despite the challenges, this architectural change brought some surprising benefits:

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Our frontend and backend became truly separate, making it easier to reason about each part of the system.

2. **Improved Development Experience**: Once set up, developers could work on frontend and backend components independently.

3. **Enhanced Type Safety**: With explicit JSON interfaces between Rails and Astro, we got better type checking and clearer contracts between components.

## Looking Forward

This experiment showed that while Rails' conventions are powerful, there's value in thoughtfully breaking them when needed. The key is understanding the implications and being prepared to handle the cascading effects of such changes.

For those considering a similar architecture, here are some tips:

1. Plan your routing strategy carefully
2. Consider the performance implications of cross-server communication
3. Invest time in proper error handling
4. Document your conventions thoroughly

Breaking Rails isn't always bad - sometimes it leads to better architectures than we initially imagined.
