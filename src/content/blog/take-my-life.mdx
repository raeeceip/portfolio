# WARNING: 
### This post talks heavily about suicidal ideation, and personal trauma. Scroll away now or look at some of my [other](https://chiso.dev/blog) blog posts to see some light hearted and programming related posts. 

On the 1st of January, 2022 , I made the decision to start to learn how to program, mostly because I believed it woild help me achieve the life i wanted,and for the most part it did. 

In a completely unrelated series of events, I got the opportunity to move to Canada, and took it as a sign to make the best out of my new foind interest, and my drive to succeed increased. Night adter night id spend learning how to program, learning python, courtesy of [Mosh Hamedani] (https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?si=-VnadnZr4a0FryF4).
I had fully resolved to succeed as a developer, and woild soend the next two years or so trying to learn everything I could,mostly about web development, and core programming concepts. My early projects ranged from discord bots, to small websites , to full django applications. It was cool to know that I could use my laptop to do things that weren't just pirating games and rooting and installing new operating systems on my phone. I could show someone that I wrote code, and the code did something.

# So how did the move pan out? 

By the time I had landed in Canada, i had a few projects that I was sort of proud of, from Wordpress plugins, to discord bots, to my first portfolio website.

** insert gif of it wasn't much, but its honest work ** 

I felt that if i tried hard enough , it would pan out so quickly, and id join the success stories of peolle making life-changing salaries on twitter, or at least finally be able to feed myself. 
> Spoiler : It wasn't that easy. 

My first few weeks were focused on getting me settled, trying to stabilize, as there are certain circumstances in my immigration that had made me need to find a job, and fast. And so I did. 
My first job was as a cook at the [Carleton Cafeteria](https://g.co/kgs/MZNQmpQ) where I made omlettes and sandwiches to get by, and survive while I learnt more on the side. I had started my first classes , and my major was at thst time , Psychology. Until one day. 

## The big pivot
I had taken an elective that year , an intro to computer science class, by a man named Robert Collier, and he taught it in python, a language i was faimilar with, I was so excited! 
I found myself going to his classes everyday, and made friends with people who were taking his advanced classes in Haskell, which I attended as well. I had starred to love programming, not just as a career opportunity, but as a concept too. I got an A in that class, and made the decision the next semester to switch, and started my journey as a computer scientist. 

> Did I make it?
No, not even close, the circumstances surrounding my life still remained, and if I ever wanted to succeed. My career still hinged on me being able to eat and wake up the next morning, so I continued working in kitchens, and perservered. So far I've worked in roughly 5, and it kept the lights on for a while, though not without its determents.
I had been  depressed , long before I moved, and the hustle and bustle of kitchens only furthered my depression, as I had started to see less and less of my friends, family and gained more cuts and burns cause of my clumsy nature. I wasnt initially cut out for the kitchen, but i stayed anyways, cause I needed to make sure I succeeded. 
I could go into detail about what what meant, everything from chainsmoking to avoid eating during work hours so I could afford dinner, or pay my bus fares , or phone bills, to sleeping on a couch so I could wake up in the mornings and walk right out of the house and straight to work. none of these things were necessary by choice, and i do not claim tk be a victim of circumstance, they are merely things that happened. 
I tried and tried and tried, and as of today I have a plethora of applications, cold emails, and scholarship applications to the tune of ~580, and as at the time of writing this they may have doubled, but for now they exist [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U0LzpH36CmM8Y0yrurnnih2i2UKAGJGemXFiVPqmKGQ/)

I had started networking, and made a few connections within the ottawa area, from java meetups, open source contributors, and Ruby meetups; the one that granted me my first opportunity. 
> Im skimming through a lot of content here, but depending on how this is recieved i could go into detail about them, if anyone is interested. 
# Fullscript
My first and internship was this summer, where I had the opportunity  to work in an amazing company, where I learnt the language I use primarly for my projects, callled Go. I had also disxovered that there were exceptionally talented and hardworking people who had gone through similar things that I did, and had made it out of the other end of the fires, and into success. It felt like a dream come true. 
I tried to make the most of it, moved out of my friends place to have a workspace, worked on learning as much of the language, programming styles and conventions, and to some extent it worked. I had gotten approval to lead my own meetup, specifically to find more people interested in this language, and had gotten better as a programmer in 4 months tha I had alone( they are also the reason why every repository of mine starts with a shell script now, but more on that later) 
It was a dream cone true, but alas all dreams come to an end, and I had to face the reality of either trying to get a return offer, or find a new job, neither of which were easy , and both of which I had failed to do.

## rebuilding 

my failure cane with its own unique set of challenges, one emergency had wiped my savings away, and I had ti start to frantically look to methods to pay my bills, and survive once more. It took a tool on my health, and I lost far more than I had anticipated. Relationships I worked hard to cultivate were gone, and I had no ide what or how to build or start over. So I went back to what I knew , cooking 

As at the time I am writing this, I work as a. dishwasher down on sparks , and a part time cook for a nightclub. Fun times. I can'texcape the thouhts in my head that cause me to lose hope for my future, even though it may be bright, and all this work will eventually pay off. 

Ive resolved to continue to do this until im stable again, and can continue to build the things i started, and push forward as much as I can. But each rejection hits harder this time, as I have more at stake than before. 
I have people who believe in me, look up to the things ive accomplished and see a future far brighter than the one I can see for myself, and the pressure from that alone is hard enough to bear I want to run away , or hide somwehere away from all the responsibility I've accumilated for myself, but theres no where to hide. 
Each day I wake up with far less of a reason to live than the last, but I perservere solely because of the friends and family that do believe in me, regardless of what my head tells me, or what reality is showing me.

## To my friends and family: 
I wrote this with you in mind, because I hooe youre right. I hooe one day that things work out, and I dont have to worry about some of these things anymore. I have thoughts that prompt me everyday to end this, and save myself from being so miserable everyday, and relieve your worrying. I am well aware of my wins, and while many, are not in as much of a surplus as my failures. 
I am filled with these ideations, and where as I am not prompted to jump in a river or do some insane life terminating act, day by day this hustle takes a little life out of what I have left in the reserve, and the reserve isn't that much. If I do drop, i want you to know that I kept trying because of you, and I will keep trying until that day comes, or until you are all proven right. I hate myself for feeling this way, and I know you hate to see this too, but these feelings are all I can muster, and these thoughts I've written barely cover half of ahats actually hPpening. 

# And to you, dear reader 
What will you do with the opportinities you e been give? Did you wake up today with your heart set on your goals? Or have you already achieved them? 
regardless if what cards you've been dealt i implore you, like myself to persevere, and see what happens 

> Or come take my life instead, before I do.
