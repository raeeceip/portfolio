# WARNING: 
### This post discusses suicidal ideation and personal trauma. If you're looking for lighter content, please check out some of my [other blog posts](https://chiso.dev/blog) about programming.

On January 1st, 2022, I made the decision to start learning how to program, mostly because I believed it would help me achieve the life I wanted—and for the most part, it did. 

In a completely unrelated series of events, I got the opportunity to move to Canada. I took it as a sign to make the best of my newfound interest, and my drive to succeed increased. Night after night, I'd spend time learning how to program, starting with Python, courtesy of [Mosh Hamedani](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?si=-VnadnZr4a0FryF4).

I had fully resolved to succeed as a developer and would spend the next two years trying to learn everything I could, mostly about web development and core programming concepts. My early projects ranged from Discord bots to small websites to full Django applications. It was cool to know that I could use my laptop to do things beyond pirating games and rooting my phone. I could show someone that I wrote code, and the code did something.

# So how did the move pan out? 

By the time I landed in Canada, I had a few projects I was sort of proud of: WordPress plugins, Discord bots, and my first portfolio website.

I felt that if I tried hard enough, it would pan out quickly. I'd join the success stories of people making life-changing salaries on Twitter, or at least finally be able to feed myself.
> Spoiler: It wasn't that easy.

My first few weeks focused on getting settled and trying to stabilize, as certain circumstances in my immigration meant I needed to find a job—and fast. And so I did. My first job was as a cook at the [Carleton Cafeteria](https://g.co/kgs/MZNQmpQ), where I made omelettes and sandwiches to get by while learning more on the side. I had started my first classes, and my major at that time was Psychology. Until one day...

## The Big Pivot
I had taken an elective that year—an intro to computer science class taught by a man named Robert Collier. He taught it in Python, a language I was familiar with. I was so excited! I found myself going to his classes every day and made friends with people taking his advanced classes in Haskell, which I attended as well. I had started to love programming, not just as a career opportunity, but as a concept too. I got an A in that class and made the decision the next semester to switch, beginning my journey as a computer scientist.

> Did I make it?

No, not even close. The circumstances surrounding my life remained, and if I ever wanted to succeed, my career still hinged on being able to eat and wake up the next morning. So I continued working in kitchens and persevered. So far, I've worked in roughly five kitchens, and it kept the lights on for a while, though not without its detriments.

I had been depressed long before I moved, and the hustle and bustle of kitchens only deepened my depression. I started to see less and less of my friends and family, and gained more cuts and burns because of my clumsy nature. I wasn't initially cut out for the kitchen, but I stayed anyway because I needed to make sure I succeeded.

I could go into detail about what that meant—everything from chain-smoking to avoid eating during work hours so I could afford dinner, or pay my bus fares, or phone bills, to sleeping on a couch so I could wake up in the mornings and walk right out of the house and straight to work. None of these things were by choice, and I do not claim to be a victim of circumstance; they are merely things that happened.

I tried and tried and tried, and as of today, I have a plethora of applications, cold emails, and scholarship applications to the tune of ~580, and as of the time of writing this, they may have doubled, but for now they exist [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U0LzpH36CmM8Y0yrurnnih2i2UKAGJGemXFiVPqmKGQ/).

I had started networking and made connections within the Ottawa area, from Java meetups to open source contributors, and Ruby meetups—the one that granted me my first opportunity.

# Fullscript
My first internship was this summer, where I had the opportunity to work in an amazing company where I learned the language I now use primarily for my projects, called Go. I had also discovered that there were exceptionally talented and hardworking people who had gone through similar things that I did, and had made it out of the other end of the fires and into success. It felt like a dream come true.

I tried to make the most of it—moved out of my friend's place to have a workspace, worked on learning as much of the language, programming styles, and conventions as I could, and to some extent, it worked. I had gotten approval to lead my own meetup, specifically to find more people interested in this language, and had gotten better as a programmer in 4 months than I had alone (they are also the reason why every repository of mine starts with a shell script now, but more on that later).

It was a dream come true, but alas, all dreams come to an end, and I had to face the reality of either trying to get a return offer or find a new job—neither of which were easy, and both of which I failed to do.

## Rebuilding 

My failure came with its own unique set of challenges. One emergency had wiped my savings away, and I had to start frantically looking for methods to pay my bills and survive once more. It took a toll on my health, and I lost far more than I had anticipated. Relationships I worked hard to cultivate were gone, and I had no idea what or how to build or start over. So I went back to what I knew: cooking.

As of the time I am writing this, I work as a dishwasher down on Sparks and as a part-time cook for a nightclub. Fun times. I can't escape the thoughts in my head that cause me to lose hope for my future, even though it may be bright, and all this work will eventually pay off.

I've resolved to continue this until I'm stable again, and can continue to build the things I started, and push forward as much as I can. But each rejection hits harder this time, as I have more at stake than before.

I have people who believe in me, who look up to the things I've accomplished and see a future far brighter than the one I can see for myself, and the pressure from that alone is hard enough to bear. I want to run away or hide somewhere away from all the responsibility I've accumulated for myself, but there's nowhere to hide.

Each day I wake up with far less of a reason to live than the last, but I persevere solely because of the friends and family that do believe in me, regardless of what my head tells me, or what reality is showing me.

## To My Friends and Family
I wrote this with you in mind, because I hope you're right. I hope one day that things work out, and I don't have to worry about some of these things anymore. I have thoughts that prompt me every day to end this and save myself from being so miserable, and relieve your worrying. I am well aware of my wins, and while many, they are not in as much of a surplus as my failures.

I am filled with these ideations, and whereas I am not prompted to jump in a river or do some insane life-terminating act, day by day this hustle takes a little life out of what I have left in reserve, and the reserve isn't that much. If I do drop, I want you to know that I kept trying because of you, and I will keep trying until that day comes, or until you are all proven right. I hate myself for feeling this way, and I know you hate to see this too, but these feelings are all I can muster, and these thoughts I've written barely cover half of what's actually happening.

# And to You, Dear Reader
What will you do with the opportunities you've been given? Did you wake up today with your heart set on your goals? Or have you already achieved them?
Regardless of what cards you've been dealt, I implore you, like myself, to persevere, and see what happens.

> Or come take my life instead, before I do.
