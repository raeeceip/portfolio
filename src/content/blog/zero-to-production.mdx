### Introduction

This week, I dedicated my time to deploying five applications from my repository to production. Below, I will document the progress, challenges, and solutions I encountered along the way. The apps include a mix of personal tools, web applications, and utilities. Here's a breakdown of the applications:

---

### The Applications

1. **R3vr**  
   A Go-based command-line tool for browsing and interacting with websites through the terminal.  
   **Technologies**: Go, Terminal UI  
   **Deployment**: GitHub Container Registry

2. **Warehaus**  
   An inventory management system built using Next.js. It leverages AWS Amplify for front-end hosting, AWS RDS for the backend, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.  
   **Technologies**: Next.js, AWS Amplify, AWS RDS, API Gateway, Vercel  
   **Deployment**: AWS, Vercel

3. **Otto**  
   A load balancer written in Go that uses configuration files to distribute server loads across multiple ports.  
   **Technologies**: Go, Qo5 (a load balancing algorithm), Config Files  
   **Deployment**: GitHub Actions, Docker

4. **Portfolio Website**  
   A personal portfolio hosted at [chiso.dev](https://chiso.dev), showcasing projects and experience, built using Astro.  
   **Technologies**: Astro, Fly.io, GitHub Container Registry  
   **Deployment**: Fly.io, GitHub

5. **Data-Buddy**  
   A utility to efficiently index and display large CSV datasets, part of my implementation of the Maestro feature in the OICR desktop application.  
   **Technologies**: TypeScript, Wails, Electron  
   **Deployment**: GitHub Packages, Docker

### Deployment Process

I took a unique approach to each project based on the requirements and the tools I used.

#### R3vr

For **R3vr**, my goal was to decide whether I wanted this to be a standalone CLI tool or a package that could be installed from a registry. Since I wanted the flexibility of both options, I chose to release it as a package that can be pulled from the GitHub Container Registry.  
Here’s a snippet of the deployment pipeline:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: 1.18
      - name: Build
        run: go build -o r3vr
      - name: Push to GitHub Container Registry
        run: |
          docker build . -t ghcr.io/your-username/r3vr:latest
          docker push ghcr.io/your-username/r3vr:latest
```

#### Warehaus

For **Warehaus**, I utilized a variety of AWS products, including AWS Amplify for the front end, AWS RDS for the PostgreSQL database, and API Gateway to manage traffic. GitHub Actions automated the deployment process, pushing changes to Amplify on each commit.  
One challenge I faced was ensuring that the deployment process remained consistent across AWS services. Here’s a simplified version of the workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Amplify

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to Amplify
        run: amplify publish --yes
```

#### Otto

The deployment for **Otto**, a load balancer, was a bit more complex. Using Go and Qo5, I ensured the load distribution could be handled via config files. GitHub Actions was again a great help in automating this, deploying the app to Docker containers. You can check out the documentation for Otto’s API [here](link to Otto documentation).

#### Portfolio Website

My new [portfolio website](https://chiso.dev), built with Astro, was deployed to Fly.io. One issue I faced was ensuring a smooth CI/CD process. I resolved it by adding a GitHub Actions workflow that pushes the latest build to Fly.io automatically on each commit. Here’s a snippet:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Fly.io

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build Astro Site
        run: npm install && npm run build
      - name: Deploy to Fly.io
        run: fly deploy
```

#### Data-Buddy

**Data-Buddy** was deployed using GitHub’s package manager. I ran into some issues with package conflicts, but resolving them involved better management of my version control and dependencies. I used the GitHub Packages registry for this deployment:

```yaml
name: Build and Publish

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Wails App
        run: npm run build
      - name: Publish to GitHub Packages
        run: npm publish
```

### Production Reflections

"Production" is the point where your code interacts with the outside world. It's not just about deploying but also ensuring others can run, test, and build your application while maintaining quality and security. There are numerous protocols to keep your application secure and efficient, and cybersecurity teams work hard to make sure only the necessary parts are 100% safe.  
Here’s what I’ve learned:

- **Avoid high-cost providers**: Choose scalable solutions that align with your budget.
- **Set alerts**: Use monitoring tools to track uptime, errors, and performance.
- **Maximize visibility**: If your app is only live for a short period, ensure it's seen and used during that time.

Production, in a way, also lives in memory—it is remembered as long as the application has been used.

You can find the source code for each application in their respective repositories:

- [R3vr](https://github.com/raeeceip/r3vr)
- [Warehaus](https://github.com/raeeceip/warehaus)
- [Otto](https://github.com/raeeceip/otto)
- [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/raeeceip/portfolio)
- [Data-Buddy](https://github.com/raeeceip/data-buddy)

Each repo contains workflows and more details in the `.github` folder. Check out the ReadMe files for further documentation.

### Conclusion

Deploying applications to production can be a complex process, but with the right tools and planning, it becomes manageable. I’ll continue updating this post with more insights as I refine these workflows.
