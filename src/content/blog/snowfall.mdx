# Snowfall

Walking through this morning's snowfall, I was struck by the importance of preparation. Though winter's arrival wasn't unexpected, it served as a stark reminder of how easily we can become complacent. The time to winterize homes and ready vehicles isn't when the first flakes fall â€“ it's well before.

Last winter gave me a front-row seat to nature's transformative power, and that experience led to overconfidence. I've learned that consistent effort matters, even when it doesn't seem to. The work we put in always counts, even if the results aren't immediately visible.

This year will be different. But as I reflect, I wish I had done more, said more, pushed harder toward my goals. Yet I take comfort in knowing my journey isn't over. The fire that drives me will guide me through these cold months, even without my north star.
