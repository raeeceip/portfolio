        During my free time and outside my day job, I work on a ton of side projects sometimes in different tools/languages and for various reasons; mainly to explore and learn new and old things. I am very interested in making developer tools and trying out new (to me) technologies to see things from a different perspective and fill in the blanks for things I may not know from working with my usual stack. Here are some of the things I have handpicked but you can find a lot more of them on my <a href="https://github.com/raeeceip" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

      <div class="mt-10 space-y-8">
        {projects.map((project, index) => (
          <div class={index % 3 === 1 ? "transform rotate-0.5deg" : index % 3 === 2 ? "transform -rotate-0.5deg" : ""}>
            <ProjectListItem project={project} />
          </div>
        ))}
